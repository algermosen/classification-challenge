# Challenge Module 13: Classification Models

Learnings:

- Different Models Fit Different Data: Some models, like RandomForest, are better at handling complicated data, while simpler models like LogisticRegression work better for more basic patterns.
- Accuracy Shows Which Model’s Better: Higher accuracy means a model is predicting more correctly, so comparing accuracy scores helps decide which model is doing a better job.
- Trying Different Models Matters: Testing different models on your data helps find which one works best. Here, RandomForest worked better, so we’d probably stick with it for this dataset.
